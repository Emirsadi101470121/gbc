## Week 1 - History
- It's fascinating how a single writing system can be used by multiple languages, kind of like how the Latin alphabet works for English, Spanish, and French.  
- Cuneiform has such a weird and unique look—it's hard to believe people actually used it for everyday writing.  

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- A writing system isn’t tied to just one language; it can spread across cultures and evolve over time.  
- Cuneiform looks like an ancient secret code—it's incredible how people managed to read and write with it.  

## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Handling special characters properly is crucial, or things can break in unexpected ways.  
- Markdown and HTML serve different purposes—Markdown is simple and great for formatting text, while HTML gives more control over structure.  

## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- Keyboard shortcuts can be overwhelming at first, but they make work so much faster once you get used to them.  
- Regex is both powerful and confusing—when it works, it feels like magic, but getting it right can be frustrating.  

## Week 5 - CLI (Command Line Interface)
- The CLI has a steep learning curve, but once you start using it, you realize how efficient it makes everything.  
- Writing scripts takes effort, but it automates repetitive tasks and makes life easier.
